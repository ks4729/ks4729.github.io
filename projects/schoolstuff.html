            <h2>Augmented Nerf Blaster</h2>
            <p class="lead">For the final for an Engineering Design and Problem Solving class, we were offered to 
              finally implement the nerf blaster augmentations that had constantly been delayed. 
              I had set up my teachers 3D printers, so I naturally wanted to incorporate them into my project, 
              but I also wanted to work with Electronics with a friend who was insane with Arduinos. We proposed 
              a project that would take an old knock off nerf blaster, make it compatible with nerf darts, and make 
              it automatically launch darts when something passed in front of it. The final product wasn’t extremely 
              mobile, but worked. Because I had so many AP exams, I was exempt from several finals, and because finals 
              week is just half days, I spent upwards of 5 hours a day after school working on the project, as well 
              as long nights at home. </p>
            <h2>English Augustine paper</h2>
            <p class="lead">For an English paper, after reading Frederick Douglass, we were told to read an autobiography by an author of color. I chose St. Augustine’s Confessions, and picked up the Loeb Classics version to read in the Latin and have the English nearby if I got stuck. My teacher approved, as I had already read our assigned readings of the Bible in St. Jerome’s Vulgate, as opposed to the King James Version she assigned. When I sat down to write this paper, I researched the distinction of pantheism, panentheism, and various other shades of religious beliefs. I conducted interviews of a friend who was reading Spinoza’s Ethics, which is where the term pantheism is first mentioned, and my grandmother, who knows a lot more about Sikh philosophy than me. Ultimately, the version I submitted was a lot more toned down than I would have liked, because I was given a word limit.
