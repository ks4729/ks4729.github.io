            <p class="lead">Having prepared for months for a regional Latin competition, I was disappointed when it was canceled during the Texas snowstorm in February of 2021. Using my neighbor’s internet, I created my own version of one of the many competitions called <a href="https://www.njcl.org/certamen">Certamen</a>, which is a quiz-bowl style game about Ancient Rome. In just the span of a week, I managed to find 6 different teams and write 60 unique questions and host the tournament with the help of others as moderators.This had over 20 people in attendance. The next year I recreated the tournament with even more questions, this time named "Duplex Melius Certamen", to show that it was twice better than regular certamen. I am planning on making a third this coming Spring of 2023. </p>
