            <p class="lead">“Today is my first day documenting my work, although I have been researching and thinking about this project for the last few months. I would consider today to be the start of this project. I am doing this project because the 2 cnc routers we have at school aren’t being fixed and students can’t fix them due to fear of messing up these expensive, complex machines. Having spoken with other FRC teams, it seems like a CNC router is very useful for extremely precise measurements, as we know from our initial creation of the intake. I have researched some links starting today, with a budget of around $300, using a mix of 3d printing and wood, as the tools I have at home are nothing more than a 3d printer with a 9x9x9 volume, a hand drill, and a hand saw for wood. Thus, I am limited in my materials, cost, and I hope to have this done by the end of the summer, so I am mostly free in time, which is nice due to the time it takes to 3d print parts. This project will be donated to the FRC team, so I am building this so that it will be as useful to the team as possible. This means that it should be easy to repair (if a student can make it and do it in a well documented way, then a student 5 years down the road should be able to fix it) and shouldn’t be so complex that a student couldn’t use it (3 axis no need for more, only need to cut wood and lexan for the team, shouldn’t need to be able to cut aluminum or steel as pieces big enough for a cnc router would be too heavy). “</p>
