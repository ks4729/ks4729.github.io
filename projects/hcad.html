            <h1 class="cover-heading">Helicopter CAD Project</h1>
            <p class="lead">When I learned that my school was switching to Onshape for CAD away from SolidWorks, I wanted to practice using the software over winter break, to not only help the robotics club I was part of, but also to expand my own skills with this program, which has a very steep learning curve. Because of the COVID schedule, I recreated the helicopter in Onshape and in the process improved my skills with CAD and my knowledge on how toy helicopters worked. I had to CAD concentric axles, and mate them in a very new form of assembly, as well as make an airfoil, which I can do to a much higher quality now. </p>
