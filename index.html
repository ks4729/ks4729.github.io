                    <p>My brain is still hurting after reading this, but what a book. The middle is a slog, but the ending knocked it out of the park. Too many reviews of this book focus on the surface commentary on conspiracies, but I think it's much more important if you look at the trumpet and what that means as a symbol. I'd love to talk about this with you if you come talk to me, because I have so many thoughts about this book</p>

                    <p>Uhhh, I won't pretend to have understood half of this. Recommended to me by a friend who is studying composition at a conservatory, this created a mathematical formulation for consonance and dissonance for counterpoints and broke my brain a lot. It was interesting, I think. </p>

                    <p>Absolutely amazing. I love this book so much. I can't believe it took me this long to start reading this book. The history, the theology, the final conclusion with how we search for symbols when there sometimes aren't any, all of it was great. This book, more than any book I've read before, treats you like an adult, if that makes sense. It doesn't stop to over explain, allows you to draw conclusions, presents the facts, and everything is just amazing. 10/10 a million times over</p>
